**Incentiv** is a smart account–based blockchain interaction layer designed to simplify how users earn rewards, manage assets, and interact with decentralized applications.

By leveraging **Account Abstraction**, Incentiv removes common friction points such as gas management, complex transaction flows, and fragmented wallets. This enables a unified, user-first experience across chains and assets.

Incentiv combines:

- **Smart accounts with programmable permissions**  
  Flexible accounts that adapt to user needs and application logic.

- **Bundled and sponsored transactions**  
  Perform multiple actions in a single transaction, with optional gas sponsorship.

- **Reward-based incentives for on-chain activity**  
  Earn rewards for meaningful participation across the ecosystem.

The platform is built to be **extensible**, **chain-agnostic**, and **secure by default**, making it easy for users to interact with Web3 without needing deep technical knowledge.
