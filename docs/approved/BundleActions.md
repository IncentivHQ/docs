# Bundle Actions

With Incentiv’s Bundle feature, you can seamlessly swap tokens and send them to a contact—all in a single transaction, even if you don't hold the target token yet.

> \[!NOTE]
> For this example, we are doing a swap and send bundle action

# Step 1: Navigate and click the Swap button

* In the panel beside your nickname, or the pop-up widget, you can find action buttons.
* Click “Swap” to set this as your first action in the bundle

# Step 2: Choose the token

* Select which token you want to swap into and specify the amount of tokens.
* You can use the 🔄 button if you want to switch between the origin token and the target token.

# Step 5: Overview & Confirm

* Review the transaction details, including the amount and gas fees.
* Click “Confirm” to initiate the transaction.

# Step 6.1: Validation

* A prompt will appear, asking you to verify your identity using biometric authentication (e.g., Touch ID or Face ID).
* Use your fingerprint or facial recognition to confirm the transaction.
* You can select "Use a different passkey" or "Cancel" to abort the transaction.

# Step 6.2:  Validation (Wallet Extension)

* Check the details and sign the transaction from the extension

# Step 7: Transaction Confirmation

* Once the transaction is processing, you’ll receive a notification.
