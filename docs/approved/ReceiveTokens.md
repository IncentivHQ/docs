# Receive Tokens

To receive tokens, simply copy your **0x wallet address** from the Dashboard or use your QR code and share it with the sender. All transactions must go through the Incentiv Portal—direct transfers are not supported.

### Step 1: Copy Your Address

Human-readable names are not yet available on testnet.

- Go to your **Wallet Dashboard**.
- Copy your wallet’s **0x address** (e.g., `0x1234...abcd`).
- This is your **receiving address** for testnet tokens.

## Step 2: Share Your Wallet Address

- Send your 0x address to anyone who wants to send you tokens.
- They’ll use this address in the Incentiv Portal or faucet to complete the transfer.

> [\!NOTE] \> \*\*Coming soon to mainnet: \*\*use human-readable names like `centi.incentiv`, share QR codes or ENS-style links, and skip copying long 0x addresses.

## [Coming Soon] Pending Transactions

- Once a transaction is approved, you’ll see the tokens reflected in your **balance**.
- Check the **Home Dashboard** or **Transaction History** to verify receipt.
