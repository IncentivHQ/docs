title: Advanced Account Abstraction (AAA)
description: Learn how Incentiv’s protocol-native Advanced Account Abstraction enables smart accounts, intent-based transactions, and seamless user experiences.
---

Advanced Account Abstraction (AAA) is a protocol-native account model in Incentiv that makes smart contract wallets first-class citizens.  
It replaces the limitations of traditional externally owned accounts with programmable, secure, and user-centric smart accounts, while maintaining compatibility with legacy wallets.

AAA is designed to make usability, security, and flexibility core protocol features rather than optional add-ons.

## What Makes AAA “Advanced”

Unlike application-layer account abstraction systems, Incentiv integrates AAA directly into the protocol architecture.  
This enables richer capabilities without relying on external workarounds or intermediary trust assumptions.

Key characteristics include:

- Smart contract wallets by default  
  Accounts are programmable and can enforce custom validation, authorization, and recovery logic.

- Intent-based transactions  
  Users express goals rather than low-level transaction mechanics.

- Native support for bundlers and paymasters  
  Transaction execution and fee handling are abstracted without sacrificing decentralization.

## Core Architecture

AAA in Incentiv is composed of several tightly integrated components.

### Smart Contract Wallets

Smart wallets act as programmable user accounts and define their own security and execution rules, including:

- Multi-signature authorization  
- Spending limits and policy enforcement  
- Session keys for temporary access  
- Built-in recovery mechanisms  

Each wallet validates transactions onchain according to its own logic.

### EntryPoint Contract

The EntryPoint is the universal execution gateway for abstracted transactions.

It is responsible for:

- Validating user operations  
- Enforcing wallet-defined authorization rules  
- Executing bundled actions atomically  
- Handling fee settlement and paymaster logic  

All abstracted transactions flow through this contract to ensure consistent validation and execution.

### UserOperations

User interactions are packaged as UserOperations, which represent intent rather than raw transactions.

A UserOperation includes:

- Target actions and parameters  
- Wallet validation data  
- Fee and gas payment instructions  
- Optional paymaster configuration  

This structure enables flexible execution while preserving deterministic onchain validation.

### Bundlers

Bundlers are network participants that collect UserOperations and package them into executable transactions.

Their responsibilities include:

- Validating UserOperations offchain  
- Optimizing execution order and batching  
- Submitting bundled operations to the EntryPoint  

Bundlers operate in a competitive, permissionless environment that improves efficiency and reliability.

### Paymasters

Paymasters abstract gas and fee payment from the user.

They enable features such as:

- Sponsored transactions  
- Fee payments in non-native tokens  
- Application-specific fee policies  

Paymasters are secured through staking and validation rules to prevent abuse.

## Intent-Based Transaction Flow

AAA replaces manual transaction construction with an intent-first workflow:

1. User expresses a desired outcome through a wallet or dApp  
2. The wallet translates the intent into a UserOperation  
3. A bundler validates and packages the operation  
4. The EntryPoint enforces wallet rules and executes the action  
5. Fees are settled via the wallet or an attached paymaster  

This flow removes the need for users to manage gas, nonces, or raw calldata directly.

## Security Model

AAA improves security by design rather than relying on a single private key.

Security features include:

- Programmable authorization logic  
- Multi-device and multi-party approval  
- Policy-based transaction controls  
- Built-in recovery and key rotation  

Each wallet defines its own threat model and enforcement rules, all validated onchain.

## Usability Benefits

By abstracting protocol complexity, AAA enables:

- One-click onboarding  
- Gasless or sponsored interactions  
- Automated and scheduled actions  
- Seamless dApp experiences comparable to Web2  

Users interact with outcomes, not infrastructure.

## Developer Advantages

AAA expands the design space for developers by allowing them to:

- Build wallet-native logic and automation  
- Integrate custom paymaster and bundler strategies  
- Rely on standardized execution and validation flows  
- Deliver consumer-grade experiences without compromising decentralization
