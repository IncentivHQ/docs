# Tap to Unlock: How Passkeys and Smart Wallets Are Redefining Crypto Access

Forget everything you thought you knew about crypto wallets.

No more writing down recovery phrases. 
No browser extensions.
No panic if you lose your phone.

With passkeys and smart contract wallets on **Incentiv**, your next wallet could be as simple and secure as unlocking your device. Let’s break down how this shift works, and why it’s a game-changer for both new and experienced users.

## A New Kind of Wallet Experience

Creating a wallet on Incentiv feels like signing into an app. It is fast, seamless, and secure.  

- No seed phrase appears.  
- No backup instructions to follow.  
- You just use your phone’s Face ID, fingerprint, or system password to confirm.  

**That’s it.**

This is made possible through a combination of **passkeys** and **Account Abstraction (AA)**. Together, they create a smarter kind of wallet that is easier to use and much harder to lose.

## What Makes Passkeys Different

Passkeys are already integrated into most modern devices. You use them every time you:

- Unlock your laptop with a fingerprint  
- Approve a payment using Face ID  
- Tap “Sign in with Google”  

Instead of relying on a typed password, you authenticate using your fingerprint, face, or device PIN.

Behind the scenes, a private-public key pair handles the verification process. This system proves your identity without ever storing or transmitting a password.

**In the context of crypto, this brings major advantages:**

- No passwords or seed phrases to manage  
- Your private keys stay securely on your device  
- Everything works smoothly across devices that support **WebAuthn** and **FIDO2** standards  

All of this replaces the need for traditional private keys while maintaining the strength of modern cryptography.

## What’s Happening Under the Hood

On Incentiv, passkeys work because the network uses **Account Abstraction**.

**In simple terms:**

- Every user transaction is sent to an **EntryPoint** smart contract  
- Signature checks happen in the **wallet logic**, not on the **consensus layer**  
- This allows wallets to support **alternative signature curves** like **P256** (used by passkeys)  
- Ethereum-style consensus still runs on **secp256k1**, so core security remains untouched  

This architecture gives wallets new powers without changing the blockchain itself.

## Your Wallet, On-Chain and Upgradeable

When you create a wallet on Incentiv, you’re not just opening an account, you’re deploying a smart contract wallet directly on-chain. This wallet uses your device-native passkey to sign actions, giving you seamless and secure access.

It also supports multiple keys, meaning you’re not limited to just one device or method of access. You can:

- **Authorize** phones, laptops, or other trusted devices  
- **Instantly revoke access** if one is lost or stolen  
- **Update and manage access anytime**, without redeploying  

Because the wallet logic lives on-chain, there’s no need to start over, your wallet grows with you.


## What Happens If You Lose Your Phone?

**No panic.**

Incentiv wallets are designed for **multi-key recovery**. That means:

- You can authorize a backup device or EOA  
- If one key is lost, use another to access your wallet  
- Revoke access from the lost device with a single call  

No seed phrase needed. No risky backups. Just better design.

## EOAs Are Still Welcome

If you’re still using MetaMask or another EOA-based wallet, there's no need to switch right away.

Incentiv lets you:

- **Connect** your existing EOA directly to your new passkey wallet  
- **Fund** your passkey wallet from your EOA  
- Set your EOA as a **backup signer** 
- **Keep your seed phrase** for peace of mind  

EOAs and passkeys aren’t competitors, they complement each other. Incentiv’s Account Abstraction logic supports multiple authentication methods, allowing them to work together seamlessly.

## Security Prompts from Your Device? That’s Normal

You might notice your phone asking for Face ID or your laptop requesting a system password when using your wallet.  

That’s not a feature from Incentiv, it’s your device doing its job to keep you safe.

- Your passkey is protected by your **device’s secure hardware**  
- All authentication **stays on your device** and is never shared  
- Only your **face, fingerprint, or system login** can approve actions  

These prompts are part of your device’s native security, no extra steps required.

## Ready for Recovery: Social Recovery Infrastructure

One of the most exciting upcoming features in Incentiv wallets is **social recovery**. While not live yet, the infrastructure is already in place.

Users will be able to:

- Choose **trusted contacts** or **backup wallets** for recovery  
- Set **custom rules**, such as requiring approval from 2 of 3 guardians  
- Recover access transparently and securely, **on-chain**, without central authority  

When available, it will feel much like **“Forgot Password”**, but with decentralized security.

## Developer and UX Benefits

This isn’t just better for users, it’s a game-changer for developers too.

With Incentiv’s passkey-enabled wallets:

- Developers can build dApps without teaching users about keys or seed phrases  
- Users don’t need to learn what a seed phrase or gas fee is  
- The ecosystem becomes safer, simpler, and more accessible to the next billion users

This isn’t a shortcut. It’s a smarter wallet architecture, combining usability and security without compromise.

## What Powers It All

Every user action in Incentiv is packaged into a UserOperation and routed through the EntryPoint contract, the core of Account Abstraction.

**Key Highlights:**

- **Signature validation** is handled within the wallet logic, not at the base chain layer  
- Support for **P256** allows passkey login from any compliant device  
- Wallets are deployed **deterministically** via the Account Factory for predictable addresses  
- **Multiple authentication methods** supported: EOAs, passkeys, multisig, and future schemes  
- All key authorization logic is managed via **smart contracts**  
- Includes **gas-optimized paths** for efficient signature verification and key management  

## Try It Now

You don’t need an extension. You don’t need a seed phrase. You just need your phone, laptop, or any passkey-ready device.
