### **1. The Core Currency: XP & Rewards**

Your total XP determines your Rank on the global leaderboard.

- **Total XP:** This is a combination of your on-chain actions, badges, mystery box pulls, and referral bonuses.
- **The Conversion:** At the end of the season, your final XP score will be **translated directly into rewards.** The more XP you accumulate, the larger your claim on the ecosystem's season rewards pool.

### **2. Tier Percentiles & Multipliers**

At the end of the season, your raw XP is not your final score. Your final score is calculated by applying a **Season Multiplier** based on the Tier you finish in.

| **Tier Badge** | **Rank Requirement** | **End-of-Season Multiplier** |
| :------------- | :------------------- | :--------------------------- |
| **Diamond**    | Top 1% of Players    | **2.0x (Double XP)**         |
| **Gold**       | Top 5% of Players    | **1.5x**                     |
| **Silver**     | Top 20% of Players   | **1.3x**                     |
| **Bronze**     | Everyone Else        | **1.0x (No Multiplier)**     |

**Example:** If you grind 10,000 XP and successfully defend your rank in the **Diamond** tier, your final score—used to calculate your rewards—becomes **20,000 XP**.

ֿ**3. Season Achievement Badges**

Climbing into higher tiers doesn't just grant you a multiplier; it earns you prestigious **Season Badges** and additional one-time XP bonuses:

- **Silver Surfer:** Finish the season in the Silver Tier (**200 XP** bonus).
- **Golden God:** Finish the season in the Gold Tier (**500 XP** bonus).
- **Apex Predator:** Finish the season in the Diamond Tier (**1,000 XP** bonus).

### **4. Defense is the Best Offense**

The leaderboard is dynamic. To secure your multiplier and maximize your final reward translation, you must stay active:

- **Daily Velocity:** Push for 20+ transactions daily to hit the higher XP-per-action tiers (up to \$20~XP/tx\$).
- **Consistency:** Maintain your rank percentile to prevent other players from "leaping" over you in the final days of the season.
