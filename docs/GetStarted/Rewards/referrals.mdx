title: "Referrals Guide"
---

Referrals turn your influence into lasting rewards. By inviting others to participate in the network, you unlock a compounding stream of Gas - Activity XP generated not just by your direct invites, but by the growing network that follows them. Every real on-chain action strengthens your position, expands your reach, and accelerates your progress through the ranks. This system is designed to reward genuine adoption — encouraging you to bring in active participants and build a network that continues working for you long after the initial invite.

### **1. The 3-Layer Reward Structure**

You earn a percentage of the **Gas-Activity XP** generated by your entire downstream network across three distinct layers:

- **Layer 1 (Direct Invites):** Earn **20%** of the XP generated by people you personally invite.
- **Layer 2 (Friends of Friends):** Earn **7.5%** of the XP generated by users invited by your Layer 1 contacts.
- **Layer 3 (The Network):** Earn **2.5%** of the XP generated by users invited by your Layer 2 contacts.

### **2. The Activation Rule: "Qualified Friends"**

To prevent botting and reward genuine growth, a referred user only counts toward your rewards and badges after they become a **Qualified Friend**:

- **Definition:** A friend is "Qualified" only **after** they have executed at least one gas-cost transaction (e.g., Swap, Bridge, or Transfer).
- **Strict Rule:** Inviting a user who merely connects a wallet but performs no on-chain activity results in **0 rewards**.

### **3. Referral Achievement Badges**

In addition to the percentage-based "Passive XP" streams, you can unlock one-time XP bonuses by hitting recruitment milestones for Qualified Friends:


| **Badge Name**     | **Requirement**               | **One-Time XP Bonus** | **Visual Vibe**     |
| :----------------- | :---------------------------- | :-------------------- | :------------------ |
| **The Recruiter**  | Invite 1 Qualified Friend     | **10 XP**             | Wooden handshake    |
| **Squad Leader**   | Invite 10 Qualified Friends   | **50 XP**             | Bronze whistle      |
| **Legionnaire**    | Invite 100 Qualified Friends  | **200 XP**            | Silver Roman helmet |
| **The Warlord**    | Invite 200 Qualified Friends  | **500 XP**            | Gold sword & shield |
| **Empire Builder** | Invite 500+ Qualified Friends | **1,000 XP**          | A crown on a throne |

### **4. Strategic Summary for Max Rewards**

To maximize your affiliation earnings, follow these guidelines:

- **Build Passive XP:** Share your referral link to build streams of XP that accrue while you are offline.
- **Ensure Activity:** Remind your invited friends to transact (Swap/Mint) so they become "Qualified" and activate your rewards.
- **Multiplier Defense:** Your total XP (including referral XP) determines your rank. Maintaining a high rank ensures your final scores are multiplied by up to **2.0x** at the end of the season.
