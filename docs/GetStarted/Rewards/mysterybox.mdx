### **1. How to Secure Your Boxes**

There are two primary ways to get your hands on a Mystery Box:

- **The "Activity Loop" (Free):** Earn **1 Free Mystery Box** for every **20 gas-cost actions** (Swap, Bridge, Mint, Transfer) you complete. 

  <Warning>
    **Critical Rule:** You **must open your earned box** to restart the 20-transaction counter. If a box stays unopened, your progress toward the next free one freezes.
  </Warning>
- **The "XP Purchase":** Skip the wait and buy a box for **120 XP + Gas**<sup>4</sup>. This is the ultimate "Burn to Earn" mechanic for those looking to hunt jackpots instantly.

### **2. What’s Inside?**

Every single Mystery Box contains **two** distinct drop types:

#### **A. The Guaranteed Drops**

Every box includes entries for our automated on-chain lotteries:

- **1x Weekly Lotto Ticket:** Drawn every 7 days.
- **1x Monthly Grand Lotto Ticket:** Our massive jackpot drawn every 30 days.

#### **B. The Variable Drop (One Per Box)**

You will receive one item from the following probability table:

- **Raw XP Bundles (70% Chance):** Instant XP ranging from **\+50 XP** to the legendary **\+2,000 XP Mega Injection**.
- **XP Boosters (10% Chance):** Multipliers from **1.2x to 3.0x** that supercharge your future earn rate.
- **USDC Rewards (10% Chance):** Pure liquid cash sent to your wallet, from **\$0.20 "Gas Refunds"** to **Multi-thousand dollar Jackpots**.
- **\$CENT Token Allocation (10% Chance):** Future token allocations vested until TGE, with "Whale" drops reaching **10,000 \$CENT** or more.

### **3. XP Booster Mechanics**

Boosters are the key to leaderboard dominance. They trigger automatically upon opening a box<sup>16</sup>:

- **Auto-Queue:** If you already have a booster active, the new one enters a **Queue** and activates the moment the current one expires<sup>17</sup>.
- **Stacking Intensity:** Boosters come in **4 hour** duration. Use them during "Boosted Events" to maximize your velocity.

### **4. Mystery Box Achievements (Badges)**

Opening boxes earns you one-time XP bonuses through badges:

- **First Mystery Box:** Claim/Open your 1st box (**10 XP**).
- **Pandora's Opener:** Open 10 boxes (**50 XP**).
