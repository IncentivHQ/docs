First-Time Setup helps new users get started with Incentiv by guiding them through the initial onboarding process.  
It covers wallet creation, authentication, basic security configuration, and network initialization so users can begin using the platform with minimal friction.

This setup is designed to be simple, secure, and accessible, even for users new to blockchain.

## What the Setup Includes

The first-time onboarding process includes the following steps:

- Creating or linking a smart account  
  Users create a new Incentiv smart account or link an existing compatible account.

- Enabling supported authentication methods  
  Authentication options such as passkeys or equivalent secure methods can be enabled during setup.

- Configuring basic security and recovery options  
  Users define initial security preferences and recovery mechanisms to protect account access.

- Initializing network access and indexing  
  The account is registered with the network and indexed so it can immediately interact with onchain services.

## After Setup

Once the first-time setup is completed, users can immediately:

- Send and receive assets  
- Interact with dApps and protocol features  
- Execute transactions without manually managing private keys or gas  

The smart account handles execution and fee abstraction behind the scenes.

## Wallet and Tooling Notes

This setup does not require MetaMask or similar browser wallets.

Users can onboard using Incentiv’s built-in wallet and supported authentication methods such as passkeys.  
External wallets like MetaMask are optional and primarily used for advanced workflows, such as bridging assets or connecting to third-party dApps.
