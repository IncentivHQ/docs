<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: Click “Migrate to BetaNet” on the Legacy Testnet portal" iconType="regular" stepNumber={1}>
    When you visit the original Incentiv Testnet, you’ll see a banner announcing the launch of BetaNet. Click the **“Migrate”** button to begin the transition.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2: Review the confirmation modal">
    A pop-up will appear explaining what will be moved and what will not. Your tokens, badges, and transaction history will carry over automatically. Contacts will not migrate, as contract addresses are different on BetaNet. You’ll also see that migrating early unlocks a special **Testnet Pioneer Badge**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 3: Confirm the migration">
    Click **“Confirm”** to proceed. This tells the system to begin setting up your new BetaNet account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 4: Enter your passkey to create a new BetaNet account">
    You’ll be prompted to enter your passkey. This will generate your smart wallet on the new testnet. The system will automatically link your old account to the new one.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 5: Get redirected to the BetaNet portal">
    Once your new account is ready, you’ll be sent to [testnet.incentiv.io](http://testnet.incentiv.io). You’ll see a welcome screen confirming your successful migration and showing your newly earned Pioneer Badge.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 6: Explore and use BetaNet">
    From here, you can interact with the upgraded testnet. Proof-of-Work, bundlers, badges, and new infrastructure support are fully live. You can start testing features or deploying contracts immediately.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 7: Return users are redirected automatically">
    If you try to access the old testnet again, the system will recognize your migrated status and redirect you to BetaNet automatically. You won’t need to go through the process again.
  </Step>
