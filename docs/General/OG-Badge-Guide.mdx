The **OG Badge** is awarded to users who perform their first onchain transaction within the Incentiv ecosystem. It recognizes active participation and engagement with Incentiv's features. Any confirmed transaction inside the platform counts toward unlocking this badge.

## Unlocking the OG Badge

To earn the OG Badge, you must:

* Use the Incentiv portal
* Complete at least one successful onchain transaction

Any confirmed transaction inside Incentiv qualifies.

## How the OG Badge Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Incentiv Portal">
    Go to the Incentiv portal 
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose an Onchain Action">
    Inside Incentiv, select any feature that performs an onchain transaction, such as:
    - Send tokens  
    - Swap tokens  
    - Bridge Tokens
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm the Transaction">
    Approve the transaction in your wallet and wait for onchain confirmation.


<Note> Wallet connection alone does not count. </Note>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Receive the OG Badge">
    Once the transaction is confirmed onchain, the OG Badge will be automatically awarded in the Incentiv portal.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Notes

* No external sites are needed to earn the OG Badge.
* Wallet connection alone does not count. A real onchain transaction is required.
* Badge status may take a short moment to update after confirmation.
