The **OG Badge** is awarded to users who perform their first onchain transaction within the Incentiv ecosystem. It recognizes active participation and engagement with Incentiv's features. Any confirmed transaction inside the platform counts toward unlocking this badge.

## Unlocking the OG Badge

To earn the OG Badge, you must:

* Use the Incentiv portal
* Complete at least one successful onchain transaction

Any confirmed transaction inside Incentiv qualifies.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Receive the OG Badge">
    Once the transaction is confirmed onchain, the OG Badge will be automatically awarded in the Incentiv portal.

## Notes

* No external sites are needed to earn the OG Badge.
* Wallet connection alone does not count. A real onchain transaction is required.
* Badge status may take a short moment to update after confirmation.
