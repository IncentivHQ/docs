  <Step title="Step 5: Verify Your Identity">

    - Once verified, your wallet will be generated.

<Note>
  **Tip:** On the testnet, your wallet is experimental — no real funds are involved.  
  When Incentiv moves to mainnet, you’ll be able to link your passkey or existing crypto wallet for real asset management.
