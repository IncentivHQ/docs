To start using the **Incentiv Portal**, you must first **register your wallet**. Registration connects your **0x wallet address** to the platform, allowing you to send and receive tokens, view rewards, and participate in network activities.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: Open the Incentiv Portal">
    - Go to the official [Incentiv Portal](https://app.incentiv.io) on your browser.
    - Make sure you’re connected to the **correct network** (testnet or mainnet).
    - You’ll see a **Connect Wallet** or **Register** button on the homepage.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 2: Connect Your Wallet">
    - Click **Connect Wallet**.
    - Choose your preferred wallet provider (e.g., MetaMask, WalletConnect, or Coinbase Wallet).
    - Approve the connection request in your wallet popup.
    - Your **0x address** will now appear in the portal header.

  <Step title="Step 3: Complete Registration">
    - Once your wallet is connected, click **Register**.
    - Confirm the transaction in your wallet (it’s free on testnet).
    - Wait for confirmation—this process links your address to your Incentiv account.
    - You’ll see a success message once registration is complete.
