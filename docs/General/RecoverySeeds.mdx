Safeguarding your wallet is essential. This guide explains why backups matter, and shows you exactly how to back up and recover your Incentiv account using a seed phrase (also known as a Secret Recovery Phrase).

<Warning>
  **Important:** Your seed phrase is the master key to your funds. Anyone with it can access your wallet. Incentiv cannot recover it for you.
</Warning>

# Why this matters

- **Protect against loss**: If your phone or laptop is lost, broken, or reset, your seed phrase lets you restore access.
- **Self-custody**: You remain in control. No support ticket or email reset is needed.
- **Portability**: Restore your wallet on any compatible device or wallet app.

# How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: Setup Wallet Recovery">
    When you first log into the Incentiv Portal, you’ll see a Setup Wallet Recovery screen. This is the starting point to secure your wallet with a recovery phrase (also known as a seed phrase).

    <img

      alt="Setup Wallet Recovery Pn"
      title="Setup Wallet Recovery Pn"
      style={{ width:"63%" }}
      className="mx-auto"
    />

    You’ll have two options:

    - **Close** – Skip this setup for now. (Not recommended)
    - **Setup Recovery** – Continue to create your recovery phrase backup.

    There’s also a checkbox to **“Don’t show this prompt again”** if you prefer to hide this reminder.

    <Tip>
      Always continue with **Setup Recovery** to ensure your funds are protected.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2: View and Save Your Recovery Phrase">
    After starting the recovery setup, you’ll see the **Your Recovery Phrase** screen. This is where your wallet generates a **12-word seed phrase** — the most important key to your account.

    - **Reveal your phrase**: Click the eye icon to reveal the 12 words. They must be kept in the **exact order shown**.
    - **Write it down**: The recommended method is to carefully write each word on paper. Do not rely on screenshots, cloud notes, or emails — these are unsafe.
    - **Copying for reuse**: You may copy the words during this step, but only for immediate use in the recovery verification. Never store your seed phrase digitally long-term.

      <img
        src="/images/SeedPhrases.png"
        alt="Seed Phrases"
        title="Seed Phrases"
        className="mx-auto"
        style={{ width:"44%" }}
      />

    Once you’ve safely written down your 12 words, click **“I have saved my recovery phrase”** to continue.

    <Tip>
      Double-check spelling and order before moving forward. Even one wrong letter or misplaced word will prevent successful recovery later.
    </Tip>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 3: Confirm Your Recovery Phrase" stepNumber={3}>
    To ensure that you’ve correctly backed up your recovery phrase, the **Incentiv Portal** will ask you to confirm it.

    - On this screen, some words from your 12-word recovery phrase are replaced with a **“?”**.
    - Your task is to **fill in the missing words** by selecting them from the **Available words** list below.
    - Click the correct word for each missing slot. Once placed, the box will highlight to show your progress.

    <img
      src="/images/ConfirmSeedPhrase.png"
      alt="Confirm Seed Phrase Pn"
      title="Confirm Seed Phrase Pn"
      className="mx-auto"
      style={{ width:"52%" }}
    />

    This step verifies that you have securely recorded your recovery phrase and can reproduce it accurately — an essential step for ensuring your funds can be restored if needed.

    When all missing words are filled correctly, click **“Confirm Recovery Phrase”** to complete your backup setup.

    <Tip>
      This is your final chance to check the phrase for accuracy. If any word is incorrect or misplaced, your recovery may fail later.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 4: Recovery Setup Complete" stepNumber={4}>
    Once you confirm your recovery phrase, the Incentiv Portal completes the final stage — **storing your recovery configuration on-chain**.

    This ensures that your wallet’s recovery capability is securely registered and verifiable within the Incentiv blockchain.

    During this process, you’ll see four progress stages:

    1. **Initializing** – The system prepares your recovery configuration.
    2. **Broadcasting** – The setup transaction is sent to the network.
    3. **Confirming** – The blockchain validates and confirms the recovery setup.
    4. **Completed** – Your wallet recovery is now successfully stored on-chain.

    <img
      src="/images/BackupSuccess.png"
      alt="Backup Success Pn"
      title="Backup Success Pn"
      className="mx-auto"
      style={{ width:"67%" }}
    />

    When all steps show a green checkmark, the message **“Recovery setup complete!”** confirms that everything is finalized.

    Click **“Done”** to finish the process. You can now restore your wallet anytime using your recovery phrase if you lose access to your device or credentials.

    <Note>
      The recovery phrase itself is **never stored on-chain**. Only the verification metadata confirming that recovery has been configured is recorded, ensuring both security and decentralization.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

# Recovery Process

If you’ve previously backed up your Incentiv wallet with a recovery (seed) phrase, you can easily restore access at any time — for example, if you lose your device, reset your browser, or sign in from a new environment.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1 : Start Recovery from the Welcome Screen" stepNumber={1}>
    When you open the **Incentiv Portal**, you’ll be greeted with the welcome screen.

    To restore an existing wallet, click **“Recover wallet”** at the bottom of the screen.

    This option allows you to securely reconnect to your existing account using your previously saved **seed phrase**.

    You’ll use this when:

    - You previously created a wallet and backed it up with a recovery phrase.
    - You’ve lost access to your device or browser and need to restore your wallet.
    - You want to access the same wallet on a new computer or browser.

    <img
      src="/images/RecoverWallet_step1.png"
      alt="Recover Wallet Step1 Pn"
      title="Recover Wallet Step1 Pn"
      style={{ width:"70%" }}
    />

    After clicking **Recover wallet**, the Portal will guide you to the recovery setup flow, where you can enter your seed phrase and re-establish your account.

    <Warning>
      Make sure you’re on the official Incentiv Portal URL before entering any recovery information.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2: Enter Your Recovery Phrase" stepNumber={2}>
    After selecting **Recover wallet**, you’ll be prompted to enter the **mnemonic phrase** (also known as the seed phrase) you previously backed up when setting up recovery.

    - Type or paste your **12-word recovery phrase** into the input field labeled _“Your mnemonic phrase…”_.
    - Ensure all words are entered in **the exact order** they were originally shown.
    - Each word must be **lowercase** and separated by a single space.

    <img
      src="/images/RecoverWallet-Step2.png"
      alt="Recover Wallet Step2 Pn"
      title="Recover Wallet Step2 Pn"
      className="mx-auto"
      style={{ width:"77%" }}
    />

    Once your phrase is complete, click **“Recover wallet”** to proceed.

    <Note>
      - Double-check for typos or missing spaces before confirming.
      - Your phrase is processed locally in your browser — it is **never sent to any server or stored online**.

      The system will verify your phrase and begin restoring your wallet’s configuration from the Incentiv blockchain.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 3: Set Your Wallet Password" stepNumber={3}>
    After successfully entering your recovery phrase, you’ll need to create a **new password** to secure your restored wallet.

    This password protects your wallet on the **current device** and is required to authorize any operation — such as sending tokens, swapping, or adding liquidity. It ensures that even if someone gains access to your device, they **cannot approve transactions without your password**.

    #### **How to complete this step:**

    1. Enter your new password in both fields.
    2. The passwords must match exactly.
    3. Your password must be **at least 12 characters long** — combining letters, numbers, and symbols is recommended for stronger protection.
    4. You can click the **eye icon** to view or verify what you’ve typed.
    5. Once confirmed, click **“Finish recovery”** to complete the process.

    <Info>
      **Why this step matters:**

      - This password acts as a **local security layer** for transaction approval.
      - It ensures that even with the wallet restored, actions still require your explicit authorization.
      - The password is stored **only on your device**, never on the blockchain or Incentiv servers.
    </Info>
    Once done, your wallet is fully recovered, secured, and ready for use within the Incentiv Portal.
