Token swaps on Incentiv are executed through **smart wallets** using **Account Abstraction**. This enables seamless, gas-optimized trades directly within the Incentiv Portal. Swaps are securely routed and bundled via the alt mempool, ensuring efficient execution and confirmation on-chain.

## Badge Tiers

Each successful swap earns you **Bonus XP (15%)** and progresses your **Swap Badge Tier**. The more swaps you complete, the higher your tier and rewards.
