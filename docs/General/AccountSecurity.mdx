description: Learn how Incentiv protects user accounts through smart account security and account abstraction.
---

Incentiv accounts are **non-custodial smart contract accounts** that replace traditional private-key wallets with programmable security and recovery logic enabled by **account abstraction**.

This model enhances security while simplifying user interaction by removing the need to directly manage raw private keys.

## Security Architecture

Incentiv’s security model is built on the following components:

- **Smart contract–based account validation**  
  Security rules are enforced onchain through account logic rather than a single private key.

- **Account abstraction infrastructure**  
  An ERC-4337–style architecture enables flexible authentication, transaction validation, and execution.

- **Bundlers and paymasters**  
  These components enforce transaction rules and enable advanced features such as gas sponsorship and bundled actions.

Together, this architecture allows users to interact securely without directly handling private keys.

## Authentication & Authorization

User access and transaction execution are protected through multiple layers:

- **Passkeys or equivalent cryptographic authentication methods**  
  Secure, user-friendly authentication replaces traditional seed phrases.

- **Onchain validation logic**  
  Each smart account defines the rules required to authorize transactions.

- **Explicit user approval**  
  Every transaction or bundled action must be explicitly approved by the user.

No transaction can be executed unless all validation rules defined by the account are satisfied.

## Recovery Model

Account recovery is natively integrated into the smart account design and may include:

- **Device-based recovery**
- **Delegated or social recovery mechanisms**
- **Protocol-defined recovery flows**

Available recovery options depend on the configuration selected during onboarding.

## User Responsibilities

While Incentiv provides strong security guarantees, users are responsible for:

- Securing access to authorized devices and credentials  
- Carefully reviewing transaction details before approval  
- Avoiding untrusted applications and phishing attempts
