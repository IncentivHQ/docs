### Community Rewards – 26,000,000,000 (26%)

### Short-Term Growth Fund (STGF) – 17,000,000,000 (17%)

Reserved for operational support and early ecosystem acceleration. This includes partnerships, developer grants, liquidity programs, user-growth initiatives, and core operational expenses. Vesting occurs linearly over 24 months.

### Long-Term Growth Fund (LTGF) – 20,000,000,000 (20%)

Holds tokens for long-horizon initiatives that compound network value. Vesting occurs linearly over 60 months.

### Sale – 22,000,000,000 (22%)

Tokens allocated for sale follow a structured release: 3.5% at TGE, 12.5% over the first 12 months, and the remaining 6% from months 13–24.

## Emission Phases

<Steps>

<Step title="Genesis Phase – Bootstrapping Growth">
Early emissions are higher to jumpstart adoption, liquidity, and developer activity. A preloaded Community Rewards reserve ensures meaningful payouts and attracts early participants.
</Step>

<Step title="Retention Phase – Aligning Incentives with Performance">
Rewards shift toward performance-based metrics like XP, Holder Score, and sustained activity. Active contributors earn proportionally higher rewards, reinforcing network health.
</Step>

<Step title="Sustainable Phase – Fee-Based Equilibrium">
Emissions taper while protocol fees become the primary reward source. All rewards eventually come from real on-chain activity, creating a stable, fee-driven economy.
