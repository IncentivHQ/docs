Token transfers on Incentiv are executed through **smart wallets** using **Account Abstraction**. This allows for simplified, gas-efficient transactions with support for batch processing and fee sponsorship. All transfers are routed through the Incentiv Portal and bundled via the alt mempool, ensuring secure and seamless delivery to the recipient.

## Badge Tiers

Each successful send transaction earns you **Bonus XP** and progresses your **Send Badge Tier**. The more transactions you complete, the higher your tier and rewards.
