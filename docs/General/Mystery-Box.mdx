Mystery Boxes are surprise reward items in Incentiv that let you turn XP into real rewards. Each box you open can grant XP, $CENT, boosters, or special perks. Mystery Boxes are consumable, meaning once you open them, the reward is revealed and applied instantly.
Here’s how Mystery Boxes work and how to use them effectively.
## What’s Inside a Mystery Box
Each Mystery Box pulls a randomized reward from the Prize Pool. Possible rewards include:
- XP rewards (10–200+ XP)
- $CENT tokens
- Boosters (XP multipliers like 1.1x, 1.2x, up to 2x+)
- Special perks that appear under Active Perks

The Prize Pool shows all possible rewards before you open a box, so you always know what’s at stake.
