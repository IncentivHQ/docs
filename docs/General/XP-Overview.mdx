XP is Incentiv’s core progression system. It measures your activity and contribution across on-chain and off-chain actions. XP is used to unlock features, purchase Mystery Boxes, and increase your long-term rewards.

## How XP Is Earned

XP is awarded through multiple systems:
<Steps>
  <Step title="Daily On-Chain Activity">
    Earn rewards through regular on-chain usage, including transactions, volume, and interacting with dApps.
  </Step>

  <Step title="One-Time Actions and Badges">
    Complete specific one-time actions to unlock badges and permanent achievements.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Daily Activity Streaks">
    Maintain consistent daily activity to build streaks and earn increasing rewards over time.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Mystery Box Rewards">
    Earn Mystery Boxes from activity and campaigns to unlock randomized rewards.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Referrals">
    Invite new users to the ecosystem and earn rewards when they become active.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Ecosystem Campaigns and Promotions">
    Participate in ecosystem-wide campaigns and limited-time promotions for bonus rewards.
  </Step>
</Steps>
XP is calculated regularly, with most activity-based XP updated every 24 hours.

## Daily Activity XP

<Steps>
  <Step title="Make Transactions">
    Each valid transaction earns XP, with diminishing returns after very high activity.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Increase Volume">
    Higher daily transaction volume earns more XP using a logarithmic formula.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use Multiple dApps">
    Each unique dApp used per day grants additional XP.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use the Faucet">
    Faucet usage grants XP with built-in limits.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Streak XP

<Steps>
  <Step title="Stay Active Daily">
    At least one transaction within a 24-hour period increases your streak.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Avoid Missing Days">
    Missed days reduce streak points but never below zero.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Earn Streak Rewards">
    Higher streaks translate into more XP over time.
  </Step>
</Steps>
