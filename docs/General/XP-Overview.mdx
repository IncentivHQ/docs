XP is Incentiv’s core progression system. It measures your activity and contribution across on-chain and off-chain actions. XP is used to unlock features, purchase Mystery Boxes, and increase your long-term rewards.

## How XP Is Earned

XP is awarded through multiple systems:

- Daily on-chain activity (transactions, volume, dApp usage)
- One-time actions and badges
- Streaks for consistent daily activity
- Mystery Box rewards
- Referrals
- Ecosystem campaigns and promotions

XP is calculated regularly, with most activity-based XP updated every 24 hours.

## Daily Activity XP

### Step 1: Make Transactions

Each valid transaction earns XP, with diminishing returns after very high activity.

### Step 2: Increase Volume

Higher daily transaction volume earns more XP using a logarithmic formula.

### Step 3: Use Multiple dApps

Each unique dApp used per day grants additional XP.

### Step 4: Use the Faucet

Faucet usage grants XP with built-in limits.

## Streak XP

### Step 1: Stay Active Daily

At least one transaction within a 24-hour period increases your streak.

### Step 2: Avoid Missing Days

Missed days reduce streak points but never below zero.

### Step 3: Earn Streak Rewards

Higher streaks translate into more XP over time.

## XP Multipliers

XP multipliers increase all future XP earnings.

They come from:

- Early badges
- Referral milestones
- Ecosystem promotion badges

Multipliers stack and apply automatically.
