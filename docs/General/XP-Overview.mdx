    - Transactions, volume, and dApp usage

XP is calculated regularly, with most activity-based XP updated every 24 hours.

## Daily Activity XP

<Steps>
  <Step title="Make Transactions">
    Each valid transaction earns XP, with diminishing returns after very high activity.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Increase Volume">
    Higher daily transaction volume earns more XP using a logarithmic formula.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use Multiple dApps">
    Each unique dApp used per day grants additional XP.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use the Faucet">
    Faucet usage grants XP with built-in limits.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Streak XP

<Steps>
  <Step title="Stay Active Daily">
    At least one transaction within a 24-hour period increases your streak.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Avoid Missing Days">
    Missed days reduce streak points but never below zero.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Earn Streak Rewards">
    Higher streaks translate into more XP over time.
  </Step>
