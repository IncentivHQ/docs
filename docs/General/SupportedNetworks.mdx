title: Supported Networks & Assets
description: Learn which blockchain networks and asset types are supported by Incentiv.
---

Incentiv is designed as a **chain-agnostic smart account system**, enabling users to interact with multiple blockchain networks and asset types through a single unified account.

## Supported Networks

Incentiv supports **EVM-compatible networks** that integrate with its smart account, bundler, and paymaster infrastructure. Depending on the rollout phase, supported environments may include:

- **Primary execution networks**
- **Bridged networks** accessed through approved bridges
- **Testnet and production networks**

Each supported network provides:

- A consistent smart account address per user  
- Compatibility with bundled and sponsored transactions  
- Network-level indexing for balances and activity  

Network availability and supported environments may evolve as Incentiv expands protocol integrations.

## Supported Assets

Incentiv supports the following asset types:

- **Native network tokens**
- **ERC-20–compatible tokens**
- **Bridged representations** of supported assets

Asset functionality, such as sending, swapping, bundling actions, or reward eligibility, depends on:

- Network support  
- Bridge configuration  
- Recognition by Incentiv’s indexing and validation layers  

Not all assets may be available across all supported networks.
