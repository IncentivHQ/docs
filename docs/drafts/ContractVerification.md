# Contract Verification

# Where to Verify Smart Contracts?

Incentiv supports multiple block explorers for smart contract verification. While users can select their preferred tool, we recommend ****\_****, as it provides the most comprehensive verification tools and network insights.

**Do you need an API Key?**

### Whether an API key is required depends on the network and explorer you choose:

1. <u>Explorer A</u>
2. <u>Explorer B</u>

**Verification Process**

Follow these steps to verify your contract successfully:

1. <u>Using Hardhat </u>
2. <u>Using Foundry</u>

**Common Issues & Fixes**

* <u>Incorrect Constructor Arguments</u> – Ensure you pass the exact parameters from your deployment script.
* <u>Unmatched Solidity Compiler Version</u> – Use the same compiler version for verification as in deployment.
* <u>Source Code Mismatch</u> – Verify that your uploaded source code is identical to the compiled version.
