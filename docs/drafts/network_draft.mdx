The Incentiv Mainnet is the live production environment of the Incentiv blockchain, where real economic activity takes place. It’s built for users, developers, and businesses to run Account Abstraction (AA) wallets, deploy and interact with dApps, and manage digital assets with full reliability and security.

### **What you can do on Mainnet**

- Create and use **AA smart wallets** for secure and simplified on-chain operations.
- **Send, receive, and swap tokens** across supported assets.
- **Interact with dApps** and services powered by the Incentiv ecosystem.
- Track transactions, wallets, and network metrics through **AllBlocks**, the official block explorer.

### **Key Highlights**

- **Real assets:** Transactions on mainnet are final and reflect real economic value.
- **Flexible gas payments:** Thanks to Incentiv’s **Unified Token System**, gas fees can be paid in **CENT** or any other **approved token** with sufficient balance.
- **Network stability:** The mainnet provides high performance, security, and uptime for production-grade applications.

This configuration enables seamless interaction with the Incentiv Testnet, providing a stable environment for developers and validators to test functionalities before deployment on the

## Open to Everyone

No matter your experience level, the Incentiv Testnet is designed to support your work. You can launch and test smart contracts, simulate real user activity, benchmark how your validator or bundler performs, or integrate advanced features like Paymasters and smart wallets.

From solo developers and students to full teams preparing production-grade tools, the testnet provides the same protocol-level logic you'll find on mainnet. It's a reliable place to experiment, fail fast, and iterate.

## Get Help & Resources

If you need support or want to dig deeper into the technical side of the protocol, help is available.
