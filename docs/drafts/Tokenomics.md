# Tokenomics

The Incentiv Network Coin is the native utility token that powers the Incentiv blockchain. This serves as the backbone of the ecosystem, enabling transactions, staking, governance, and incentives while fostering a vibrant and sustainable environment for users, developers, and the platform itself.

# Token Distribution

The INC token is distributed strategically to maintain network stability and encourage ecosystem growth. The distribution is structured as follows:

| Catergory                 | Allocation | Purpose                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Pre-sale and Private Sale | 30%         | Raised initial funding and incentivized early backers.                                                       |
| Team and Advisory         | 15%         | Rewards core contributors and project advisors, subject to vesting schedules.                                |
| Long-Term Treasury Fund   | 20%         | Reserved for future ecosystem development, governed by a DAO resolution.                                     |
| Short-Term Growth Fund    | 35%         | Supports marketing, operations, launchpad initiatives, airdrops, liquidity provision, and validator rewards​ |

To prevent sudden market disruptions, token distribution follows a vesting model, ensuring a gradual release based on predefined cliffs and schedules​.

# Fee Reporting

To maintain transparency and efficiency, all fees are recorded on-chain and reported through:

* <u>On-Chain Smart Contracts:</u> Automatically track and log all fees collected from transactions.
* <u>Governance Oversight:</u> Community proposals can modify fee structures based on network demand.
* <u>Analytics & Reports:</u> Users and validators can monitor fee distribution through the block explorer and governance dashboard​.

# Reward Distribution Mechanics

Incentiv’s reward distribution system ensures that network participants are compensated proportionally for their contributions.

* <u>Staking Rewards:</u> Validators and delegators receive a share of gas fees based on their staked INC tokens.
* <u>Ecosystem Incentives:</u> dApp developers, liquidity providers, and network participants earn rewards for their contributions​.
* <u>Activity-Based Distribution:</u> A real-time incentive model calculates rewards dynamically using user engagement metrics.

Rewards are automatically distributed via the Incentives Distribution Contract, ensuring fairness and efficiency​.
