description: "Oracles in the Incentiv blockchain serve as bridges between smart contracts and real-world data, enabling decentralized applications to respond to external events like market prices, weather conditions, or financial updates. By securely fetching and verifying data from multiple trusted sources, oracles ensure accuracy, transparency, and automation across the network. This allows smart contracts to execute actions automatically—such as triggering insurance payouts or updating token prices—based on real-world inputs. Through decentralized validation and cryptographic verification, Incentiv’s oracle system enhances trust, interoperability, and the reliability of on-chain operations."

# Oracles

Oracles in the Incentiv blockchain serve as bridges between smart contracts and real-world data, enabling decentralized applications to respond to external events like market prices, weather conditions, or financial updates. By securely fetching and verifying data from multiple trusted sources, oracles ensure accuracy, transparency, and automation across the network. This allows smart contracts to execute actions automatically—such as triggering insurance payouts or updating token prices—based on real-world inputs. Through decentralized validation and cryptographic verification, Incentiv’s oracle system enhances trust, interoperability, and the reliability of on-chain operations.

## Redstone

Redstone provides on-chain, push-based oracle feeds seamlessly integrated with the Incentiv network. Developers can access verified, real-time price data directly from Redstone’s decentralized nodes, enabling trustless automation of smart contract logic such as staking, collateral management, and yield computation.

For integration details and SDK examples, see the [Redstone developer guide](https://docs.redstone.finance/docs/introduction).
