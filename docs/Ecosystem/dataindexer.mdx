## Goldsky

Goldsky provides high-performance subgraphs that make data from the Incentiv blockchain easily accessible via hosted GraphQL endpoints. Developers can query [onchain activity](https://docs.goldsky.com/chains/incentiv) with low latency, customize indexing logic to suit their needs, and build fast, data-rich applications without managing indexing infrastructure.

Whether you’re building a wallet, dashboard, rewards engine, or any dApp that relies on accurate and efficient access to blockchain data — Goldsky makes it easy to scale.
