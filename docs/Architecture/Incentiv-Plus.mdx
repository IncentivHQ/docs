title: "Economic Engine: Incentiv+"
---

Incentiv+ anchors the network economy around real contribution rather than passive capital or raw hashpower. The economic engine converts meaningful actions from every role into weekly rewards, creating a system that values participation, collaboration, and productive activity.

\
By tying rewards to what users, miners, developers, LPs, and bundlers actually contribute, Incentiv+ builds a more fair and sustainable incentive structure for the entire ecosystem.

## **Contribution-Based, Role-Aware Scoring**

Every participant in the network generates contribution scores based on measurable activity. Instead of relying on a single dimension of value, Incentiv+ evaluates each role on its own merits.

**Role-Based Scoring Factors**

- Hashpower efficiency for miners
- Contract deployments and upgrades for developers
- On-chain usage and real activity for users
- Liquidity depth and stability for LPs
- Throughput and accuracy for bundlers

These metrics accumulate continuously during the epoch and reflect the real work performed during that period.

## **A Unified Reward Pool for All Participants**

All economic inflows are routed into a single reward pool that powers weekly distributions. This aligns every user action with a shared value system and ensures that rewards scale with actual network demand.

**Reward Pool Sources**

- Value fees
- Gas fees
- Paymaster settlements
- Early-stage token subsidies

This unified design removes fragmentation and allows all roles to benefit from the total activity of the ecosystem.

## **Linear Gradient Distribution Model**

Incentiv+ uses a gradient-based reward curve that increases payouts based on ranked contribution. Participants who contribute more earn proportionally higher multipliers and a larger share of the epoch’s pool.

**Distribution Characteristics**

- Higher-ranked contributors earn higher multipliers
- Share of rewards increases along a smooth gradient
- Encourages continuous contribution rather than winner-take-all behavior

This creates a fair and competitive earning model that rewards consistent activity.

## **Epoch Controller for Predictable Cycles**

Incentiv+ operates on weekly epochs, providing regular, transparent cycles for contribution measurement and reward distribution.

**Epoch Controller Responsibilities**

- Finalize contribution scores
- Unlock and allocate rewards
- Open claim windows
- Reset scores for the next epoch

The weekly cadence encourages ongoing engagement while keeping the system simple, predictable, and easy to track.

## **How It Works**

Here is how the Incentiv+ economic engine operates from activity to rewards:

1. Participants perform on-chain actions\
    Mining, deploying contracts, sending transactions, adding liquidity, or bundling operations.
2. Contribution scores update in real time\
    Each action increases the role-specific score recorded during the epoch.
3. All fees flow into the unified reward pool\
    Value fees, gas fees, and paymaster settlements accumulate across the network.
4. The epoch ends and scores are finalized\
    No further changes can occur once the cutoff is reached.
5. Linear gradient distribution assigns rewards\
    Participants are ranked and receive multipliers based on contribution tier.
6. Rewards unlock and claims open\
    Users, miners, developers, LPs, and bundlers can claim their earned tokens
7. Scores reset for the next epoch\
    Everyone starts the new cycle on equal footing.

## **An Economy Driven by Real Participation**

Incentiv+ creates a reward system that reflects human behavior and contribution rather than static capital or computational dominance.\
 By linking activity, scoring, and reward distribution across weekly epochs, the engine aligns the entire network around shared growth and genuine value creation.
