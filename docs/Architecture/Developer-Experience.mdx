## **Developer Experience**

Incentiv is designed to empower developers with the same human-centric principles that guide the rest of the protocol. Builders gain access to clear tooling, predictable execution, and well-structured abstractions that make AAA, PoW mining, and Incentiv+ accessible from day one.\
By providing high-level SDKs, modular extensions, and robust debugging tools, Incentiv ensures that developers can move faster while maintaining reliability and security.

## **SDKs and APIs for Rapid Integration**

Incentiv offers comprehensive SDKs and APIs that simplify everything from account abstraction to wallet interactions. Developers can integrate AAA features without dealing with low-level transaction construction or complex execution logic.

**Developer-Focused SDKs and APIs**

- High-level AAA SDKs
- Wallet integration kits
- Application and backend APIs
- Local simulation and dedicated testnets

These tools provide the foundations for building seamless dApps, wallets, games, and automations.

## **Robust Debugging and Advanced Tooling**

Debugging blockchain applications can be challenging, so Incentiv provides concrete, developer-grade tools to make the process smoother and more transparent.

**Debugging and Tooling Features**

- Transaction tracing
- Detailed error reporting
- Transaction simulation and dry runs
- State inspection utilities

These tools help builders identify issues early, understand execution flow, and validate complex logic before going on-chain.

## **Modular Extensions for Wallets and Services**

Incentiv supports modular architecture across its account abstraction and bundling layers. Developers can extend or plug into wallet behaviors, fee models, or bundler strategies without reinventing core logic.

**Modular Extensions**

- Wallet modules for custom verification or automation
- Paymaster services for flexible fee coverage
- Bundler strategies for optimized UserOperation handling

This modularity enables rich application patterns and lets teams build specialized logic with minimal friction.

## **How It Works**

Here is how developers typically interact with Incentiv’s toolchain:

1. Choose an SDK or API for the application\
    Select AAA SDKs, wallet kits, or backend APIs based on the use case.
2. Build or integrate a smart wallet\
    Developers define policies, wallet modules, or custom authentication flows.
3. Use simulation tools for validation\
    Run transaction simulations, traces, and state inspections during development.
4. Deploy on testnets\
    Applications, wallets, and modules are tested in environments that mirror mainnet conditions.
5. Integrate paymasters or bundlers as needed\
    Developers connect custom fee models, sponsored transactions, or bundler logic.
6. Launch on mainnet\
    With tooling, debugging, and simulation complete, deployments transition smoothly to production.

## **An Ecosystem Designed for Builders**

Incentiv supports developers not only by exposing advanced features, but by making those features understandable and accessible.\
 Modern SDKs, powerful debugging tools, and modular extensions provide a strong foundation for building secure, intuitive, and high-performance applications across the Incentiv ecosystem.
