title: Incentiv Architecture
---
<Card title="Concepts" icon="lightbulb" href="/architecture/concepts">
  Incentiv is built around intent-first interactions, native AAA smart wallets,
  and contribution-scored participation. Users express outcomes, wallets compile
  deterministic UserOperations, and every action feeds into Incentiv+ rewards.
</Card>

<Card title="Consensus" icon="shield-lock" href="/architecture/consensus">
  Enhanced Ethash PoW secures the network with GPU-friendly, ASIC-resistant
  mining. Block rewards scale with demand, while longest-chain and EVM-standard
  validation ensure deterministic execution.
</Card>

<Card title="Execution" icon="cpu" href="/architecture/execution">
  Execution stays fully EVM-compatible. Intents become UserOperations, bundled
  and validated through the EntryPoint. Native DEX routing handles fee
  conversion and settlement within the AAA pipeline.
</Card>

<Card title="Advanced Account Abstraction (AAA)" icon="key" href="/architecture/aaa">
  Smart wallets are default accounts with social recovery, multi-token gas,
  session keys, and programmable policies. Bundlers, paymasters, and the
  EntryPoint enable flexible, gasless, and automated UX.
</Card>

<Card title="Economic Engine: Incentiv+" icon="coins" href="/architecture/incentiv-plus">
  Incentiv+ converts network activity into weekly rewards. Contribution-based
  scoring, a unified reward pool, and gradient distribution ensure miners,
  users, developers, LPs, and bundlers earn based on real impact.
</Card>

<Card title="Developer Experience" icon="tool" href="/architecture/dev-experience">
  Builders get AAA SDKs, wallet integration kits, simulators, tracing tools, and modular extensions for paymasters, bundlers, and wallet modules.
