Users interact via “UserOperations” representing high-level intents, executed securely through the EntryPoint contract.

  **Key Components:**

  - **EntryPoint Contract:** Gateway for validating and executing UserOperations.
  - **Bundlers:** Collect and submit UserOperations efficiently.
  - **Paymasters:** Allow fees to be paid by third parties or alternative tokens.

  **Benefits:**

  - Enhanced security and recovery options.
  - Gas abstraction and multi-token fee payments.
  - Developer flexibility to build user-friendly applications.
