  Intent-First Interactions allow users to express what they want to achieve on the blockchain without specifying how to execute it. Through Incentiv’s Advanced Account Abstraction (AAA), users can submit high-level goals (e.g., “Send 100 USDC to Alice”) and let the system handle transaction logic, gas fees, batching, and security checks. This approach removes friction for non-technical users and enables a more intuitive blockchain experience.

  **Benefits:**

  - Simplifies user engagement with smart contracts.
  - Abstracts transaction mechanics, focusing on outcomes.
  - Enhances accessibility and usability for mainstream users.
