<Card title="Score-to-Reward Loop" icon="coins" href="docs/architecture/incentiv-plus">
  The Score-to-Reward Loop is the mechanism through which contribution scores are converted into Incentiv+ rewards. The system collects 
  transaction fees and distributes them via a unified reward pool, using a gradient-based model and epoch cycles. Users’ actions continuously 
  feed back into the pool, creating a self-reinforcing economic loop.

  **Mechanics:**
  - Rewards are proportional to contribution scores.
  - Epoch-based resets prevent winner-take-all outcomes.
  - Multipliers from badges, streaks, and referrals amplify rewards.

  **Benefits:**
  - Promotes sustained engagement and consistent contributions.
  - Creates a predictable, transparent reward cycle.
  - Supports ecosystem growth and alignment of incentives.
