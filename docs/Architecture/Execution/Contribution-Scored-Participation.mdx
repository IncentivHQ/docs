<Card title="Contribution-Scored Participation" icon="gauge" href="/docs/Architecture/concepts/contribution-scoring">
  Participation in Incentiv is measured through a contribution-scored system. All network actions—on-chain transactions, dApp interactions, 
  and community engagement—are evaluated and assigned a score. This score determines rewards in a positive-sum economic loop, 
  emphasizing genuine contribution over capital or computational power.

  **Benefits:**
  - Incentivizes meaningful engagement.
  - Rewards all participant roles fairly (miners, developers, users, liquidity providers).
  - Aligns personal rewards with network value creation.
