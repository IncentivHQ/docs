Incentiv is designed around a simple idea: execution must remain deterministic and familiar, while interaction becomes human-friendly.

Most blockchains force users to adapt to the execution engine. Incentiv does the opposite. It preserves Ethereum’s proven execution model and builds a modern interaction layer around it—one that supports intent-based actions, flexible gas payments, and automated flows without sacrificing predictability or security.

### Determinism at the Core

Smart contracts on Incentiv run inside an unmodified EVM. Opcodes, state semantics, gas rules, and execution behavior are identical to Ethereum. State transitions are deterministic, reproducible, and fully auditable.

This foundation is intentional. Determinism is what makes contracts safe, composable, and verifiable. Incentiv does not introduce new execution semantics or alternative runtimes that fragment tooling or developer mental models.

### Intent as the Interface

While execution remains traditional, interaction does not.

Users do not think in gas limits, nonces, or raw transactions—they think in outcomes. Incentiv elevates intent to a first-class concept through protocol-level Account Abstraction.

Wallets compile intent into UserOperations. Bundlers submit them. The EntryPoint validates and routes execution. From the EVM’s perspective, execution is standard. From the user’s perspective, complexity disappears.

### Separation Without Compromise

A core design principle of Incentiv is strict separation between **execution** and **interaction**.

The EVM executes code.\
The protocol manages validation, fee routing, gas abstraction, and UX-oriented flows.

By keeping these concerns separate, Incentiv can innovate aggressively on usability—sponsored transactions, unified fee settlement, automated wallets—without weakening execution guarantees or breaking Ethereum compatibility.

### Economic Awareness Around Execution

Gas and fees are measured exactly as on Ethereum, but settled more flexibly. Unified token accounting, Paymasters, and the native DEX operate _around_ execution rather than inside it.

This keeps the execution engine simple and secure, while allowing the protocol to adapt to real-world usage patterns and economic flows.
