title: "Bundlers & Alt Mempool"

---

Bundlers and the alternative mempool form the execution layer that brings Account Abstraction to life in Incentiv. While smart wallets decide _what_ a user intends to do, bundlers determine _how_ those intentions reach the blockchain efficiently and reliably.

Unlike legacy blockchains where every transaction enters a single global mempool, Incentiv maintains a dedicated pipeline designed specifically for UserOperations. This alternative mempool keeps intent-based interactions separate from raw transactions, allowing them to be batched, optimized, and validated according to rules that match the AAA model.

## The Role of Bundlers

A bundler collects UserOperations from the alternative mempool, checks that they can be executed safely, and submits them to the EntryPoint in batches. This off-chain preparation allows the network to process many user actions more efficiently than if each request were submitted individually.

Bundlers simulate each operation before submission, ensuring that the wallet approves it and that fees can be paid. If everything checks out, the bundler forms a bundle and includes it on-chain. This reduces user costs and avoids failed operations reaching the blockchain.

## Why the Alternative Mempool Matters

Separating UserOperations from traditional transactions gives Incentiv greater control over how intent-based interactions behave. The alternative mempool allows bundlers to prioritize operations based on efficiency, sponsorship, or user-permissioned policies without competing with standard transactions. It also enables better batching, improved fee strategies, and a more predictable flow for AAA interactions.

By isolating this pipeline, Incentiv avoids the congestion, ordering issues, and inconsistent validation that would arise if UserOperations were mixed directly into the classic mempool.

## How Bundlers Improve User Experience

For users, bundlers are invisible — but their impact is significant. They allow actions to feel smoother, cheaper, and more reliable. A transfer, swap, or app interaction becomes a high-level request that the bundler assembles into a ready-to-execute package. This orchestration removes the burden of gas management, reduces the chance of failed transactions, and enables applications to sponsor fees when appropriate.

Developers benefit as well. They can rely on a predictable execution path, a consistent simulation environment, and the ability to tailor how their apps interact with the AAA pipeline.

## A Coordinated Flow

Together, bundlers and the alternative mempool ensure that intent-based interactions move through the network in an optimized, structured, and trustless way. Bundlers prepare and submit the work; the EntryPoint validates and executes it; the network finalizes it.

This system allows Incentiv to offer an execution model that is more flexible than traditional blockchains while maintaining the safety and predictability users expect.
