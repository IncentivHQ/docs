title: "How AAA Works"

---

Account Abstraction (AAA) in Incentiv transforms the blockchain from a system that executes low-level operations into one that understands and processes user intent. To make this possible, the protocol introduces a new transaction model, a new execution flow, and a new foundation for how accounts behave — all without changing the user’s expectations of simplicity and safety.

## Rethinking What a “Transaction” is

In traditional blockchains, a transaction is a rigid call: a function, signature, gas limit, and a set of parameters.\

Account Abstraction replaces this with **UserOperations**, structured intent messages that express what the user wants to do, not how they must do it. Incentiv brings that to the protocol level.

A UserOperation may describe one action or many bundled together.\
The key idea is simple: the network receives a clear request, and the surrounding infrastructure determines how to execute it efficiently and safely.

## Smart Wallets as the Execution Authority

Once a UserOperation is created, it is not executed directly on the chain. Instead, it is handed off to the user’s **smart wallet**, which acts as the verification authority.

The wallet decides:

- whether the action follows the user’s rules
- whether signatures, limits, or policies are satisfied
- whether the operation should proceed, reject, or request a different fee path

The network defers to the wallet’s logic — not the other way around.\
This shifts control toward the user while enabling features like automation, recovery rules, spending policies, and more.

## The EntryPoint: A Unified Gateway

All UserOperations eventually flow into a single protocol-level entry: the **EntryPoint contract**.\
This contract orchestrates the processing of operations, ensuring they are validated, executed, and charged for gas in a unified manner.

EntryPoint does not make decisions on behalf of the user.\
It simply ensures that:

- wallet rules are respected
- fees are paid correctly
- execution is atomic
- invalid operations cannot affect others

It is the “traffic controller” that standardizes how AAA actions reach the blockchain safely.

## A Dedicated Pipeline for AAA

To support this new model, Incentiv operates a parallel processing path for UserOperations.\
This includes dedicated infrastructure for collection, batching, and execution — ensuring that intent-based actions do not compete with raw transactions.

A UserOperation, from the outside, looks like a single high-level request.\
Internally, it moves through a pipeline optimized for:

- reliability
- cost efficiency
- validation
- user safety

This separation allows Incentiv to optimize user experiences without altering how traditional transactions operate.

## A Flexible Approach to Fees

AAA enables new ways of handling fees, without imposing requirements on the user.

Although fee abstraction is explored deeper in the paymasters section, the essence is straightforward:

- the user does not need the native token
- the wallet can choose how to pay fees
- applications can sponsor actions
- the protocol ensures fees are always covered securely

This makes AAA interactions smooth, intuitive, and accessible from day one.

## Safe, Composable Execution

Once the EntryPoint validates an operation, the underlying EVM executes it as part of a normal block.\
The difference is that AAA ensures the execution environment:

- reflects the user’s intent
- enforces wallet-level verification
- handles fee routing and accounting automatically

From the miner’s perspective, it is simply another transaction.\
From the user’s perspective, it feels like a clean, guided flow.

## How It All Fits Together

At its core, AAA works because Incentiv reshapes the interaction model, not the user’s mental model:

1. The user expresses intent.
2. The wallet validates and authorizes that intent.
3. The EntryPoint coordinates the operation.
4. The operation is executed safely in a block.

This sequence allows the blockchain to feel familiar to everyday users while remaining entirely trustless and decentralized.
