Incentiv is built around a human-centric, contribution-driven design. Rather than optimizing for capital efficiency or raw throughput, the protocol focuses on intention-based interactions, native account abstraction, and an economic system that aligns all network participants.

These pillars ensure that Incentiv remains flexible, programmable, and accessible—without compromising determinism or security.

## Intent-First Interactions

Incentiv shifts users from low-level calldata construction to high-level intent expression. Instead of manually crafting transactions, users specify the outcome they want, and the wallet handles the translation.

**Users express outcomes, not calldata.**  
Wallets compile these outcomes into deterministic UserOperations.

### How It Works

- **High-level intents** (e.g., “swap”, “send”, “auto-invest”)
- **Wallet compiles UserOperations** using embedded validation logic
- **Execution remains fully deterministic** under EVM semantics

This approach improves UX while preserving reliable, predictable state transitions.

## Native Account Abstraction

Incentiv introduces Account Abstraction directly at L1, making smart wallets the default account type for every user. This eliminates EOA limitations and enables programmable authentication, fee management, and secure automation.

### Smart Wallets as First-Class Accounts

Native AAA supports:

- **Social recovery**
- **Multi-token gas**
- **Session keys**
- **Spending policies**
- **Custom verification logic**

Because AAA is native—not an overlay—wallet interactions are faster, simpler, and more secure than ERC-4337-style implementations.

## Contribution-Scored Participation

Incentiv continuously measures activity across the entire network. Every meaningful action by miners, users, developers, liquidity providers, and bundlers is tracked and converted into contribution scores.

These scores feed directly into the Incentiv+ rewards engine.

### Every Action Is Measured

- **Miners:** hashpower efficiency, uptime  
- **Users:** real on-chain activity  
- **Developers:** contract deployments and usage  
- **LPs:** liquidity depth and stability  
- **Bundlers:** throughput and accuracy  

### Direct Integration with Incentiv+

Real-time contribution scores determine weekly reward allocations during each epoch, creating a closed-loop incentive system that reinforces aligned behavior.

This foundation enables Incentiv to deliver a blockchain experience that is intuitive, efficient, and economically aligned with human behavior.
