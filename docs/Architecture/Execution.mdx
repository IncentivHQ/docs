<Card title="Intent-Driven UX, Deterministic Core" icon="sparkles" color="#fc9500" href="/docs/Architecture/AAA/AAA-Philosophy">
  High-level intents power the UX, while the EVM ensures strict, Ethereum-compatible determinism underneath.
</Card>

<Card title="Ethereum-Compatible Runtime" icon="cube" color="#ff8b00" href="docs/architecture/execution/runtime">
  Identical opcodes, state model, and semantics—full Solidity and tooling compatibility.
</Card>

<Card title="State & Gas Management" icon="gauge" href="docs/architecture/execution/state-gas">
  Ethereum-style balances, storage, gas rules, and execution flow for predictable computation.
</Card>

<Card title="Native DEX Integration" icon="right-left" color="#ff7e00" href="/docs/Architecture/Execution/native-dex">
  Internal swaps for fee conversion, paymaster settlement, and automated value routing.
</Card>

<Card title="AAA Execution Pipeline" icon="flow" href="docs/architecture/execution/pipeline">
  A structured path from intent → UserOperation → validation → execution → fee routing.
</Card>

<Card title="How Execution Works" icon="list-ordered" href="docs/architecture/execution/how-it-works">
  Wallet compiles an operation, bundlers submit it, EntryPoint validates, the EVM executes, and internal pathways finalize state.
</Card>

<Card title="Philosophy" icon="lightbulb" href="docs/architecture/execution/philosophy">
  A human-centered interaction model wrapped around a deterministic, Ethereum-proven execution engine.
