The **Incentiv Alpha Testnet** is your starting point for building, testing, and exploring the Incentiv blockchain. It’s a safe, public environment where you can try out smart wallets, simulate real activity, configure bundlers, or simply learn how the protocol works.

Whether you’re developing tools, benchmarking performance, or just getting familiar with the basics, the testnet gives you a stable, up-to-date space to interact with the network.

## Network Settings - Alpha Testnet

To connect to the Incentiv Testnet Beta, use the following configuration:

| **Name**               | **Incentiv Testnet Alpha**                                                             |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **_Network Name_**     | Incentiv Testnet                                                                       |
| **_Description_**      | The public testnet of Incentiv                                                         |
| **_RPC Endpoint_**     | http://rpc2.testnet.incentiv.io/<br />http://rpc3.testnet.incentiv.io/                 |
| **_Bundler Endpoint_** | http://bundler.rpc2.testnet.incentiv.io/<br />http://bundler.rpc3.testnet.incentiv.io/ |
| **_Chain ID_**         | 28802                                                                                  |
| **_Currency Symbol_**  | TCENT                                                                                  |

To connect to the Incentiv Testnet Beta (old), use the following configuration:

| **Name**         | **Incentiv Testnet Beta**            |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Network Name     | Incentiv Testnet                     |
| Description      | The public testnet of Incentiv (old) |
| RPC Endpoint     | https://rpc.testnet.incentiv.net/    |
| Bundler Endpoint | https://bundler.testnet.incentiv.net |
| Chain ID         | 11690                                |
| Currency Symbol  | TCENT                                |

This configuration enables seamless interaction with the Incentiv Testnet, providing a stable environment for developers and validators to test functionalities before deployment on the

## Open to Everyone

No matter your experience level, the Incentiv Testnet is designed to support your work. You can launch and test smart contracts, simulate real user activity, benchmark how your validator or bundler performs, or integrate advanced features like Paymasters and smart wallets.

From solo developers and students to full teams preparing production-grade tools, the testnet provides the same protocol-level logic you’ll find on mainnet. It’s a reliable place to experiment, fail fast, and iterate.

## Get Help & Resources

If you need support or want to dig deeper into the technical side of the protocol, help is available.

Visit the [Incentiv Docs](https://docs.incentiv.io) to find configuration guides, deployed contract addresses, and reference material. You can also join the [Incentiv Portal](https://testnet.incentiv.io) to access tools, validator setup guides, bundler resources, and community support.

**Start building confidently with the Incentiv Testnet, where innovation meets real-world readiness.**
