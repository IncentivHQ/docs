Incentiv+ is the economic layer that transforms network activity into contributor rewards by returning value to users based on measurable onchain contribution, so increased usage benefits the people driving the network forward.

You can already experience part of this economic engine on [mainnet](portal.incentiv.io) today.

## Incentiv+ on Mainnet

If a user completes more than 20 transactions in a single day on mainnet, the transactions after the first 20 qualify for Incentiv+, and the user receives value-return in CENT equal to 50% of the gas they paid on those transactions.

### Computation

1. Identify eligible transactions

- If **X ≤ 20**, **Incentiv+ = 0**
- If **X \> 20**, eligible transactions are **Tx #21 to Tx #X** based on the day’s execution order

2. Sum the gas paid on eligible transactions in **CENT**

- **Eligible Gas Paid (CENT) = Σ gas paid for Tx #21 through Tx #X**

3. Apply the Incentiv+ rate

- **Incentiv+ (CENT) = 50% × Eligible Gas Paid (CENT)**

## Sample Computations

| Scenario             | Total tx (X) | Eligible tx (X − 20) | Example fees counted (Tx #21 → #X) | Eligible Gas Paid (CENT) | Incentiv+ rate | Incentiv+ (CENT) |
| -------------------- | -----------: | -------------------: | ---------------------------------- | -----------------------: | -------------: | ---------------: |
| Less than 18 tx      | 18           | 0                    | None (threshold not reached)       | 0                        | 50%            | 0                |
| 24 tx (per-tx fees)  | 24           | 4                    | 17, 16, 15, 16                     | 64                       | 50%            | 32               |
| 35 tx (avg fee = 16) | 35           | 15                   | 16 × 15 tx                         | 240                      | 50%            | 120              |

Assume the usual gas fee per transaction is commonly around **17 CENT**, **16 CENT**, or **15 CENT**.

### Example 1 (less than 18 transactions)

If a user completes **18 transactions** in a day, they do not pass the 20-transaction threshold. That means there are **0 eligible transactions** beyond the first 20, and the user receives **0 CENT** as Incentiv+ for that day.

### Example 2 (24 total transactions, per-transaction fees)

If a user completes **24 transactions** in a day, then **4 transactions** are eligible (Tx #21 to Tx #24). If those eligible transactions have gas fees of **17 CENT**, **16 CENT**, **15 CENT**, and **16 CENT**, the eligible gas paid is **64 CENT**, and the user receives **32 CENT** as Incentiv+ (50% of 64 CENT).

### Example 3 (35 total transactions, typical fee average)

If a user completes **35 transactions** in a day, then **15 transactions** are eligible (Tx #21 to Tx #35). If the user’s typical gas fee averages **16 CENT** per transaction, the eligible gas paid is **240 CENT**, and the user receives **120 CENT** as Incentiv+ (50% of 240 CENT).
