**Incentiv+** is a feature inside the **Incentiv+ Economic Engine** that returns value to users based on daily onchain activity. 

Once a user exceeds a daily transaction threshold, they receive **Incentiv+** based on the gas they paid on the excess transactions.

## Incentiv+ Rule

### Eligibility trigger
A user must complete **more than 20 transactions in a single day** to qualify for Incentiv+.

### What Incentiv+ is based on
Incentiv+ is calculated only from the **gas paid by the user** on the transactions **after the first 20**.

- Let **X** be the total number of user transactions that day
- Eligible transaction count is **max(0, X − 20)**
- Incentiv+ rate is **50%**
- Incentiv+ is computed from the **gas paid by the user** on eligible transactions

### Computation
1) Identify eligible transactions  
- If **X ≤ 20**, **Incentiv+ = 0**  
- If **X > 20**, eligible transactions are **Tx #21 to Tx #X** based on the day’s execution order  

2) Sum the gas paid on eligible transactions in **CENT**  
- **Eligible Gas Paid (CENT) = Σ gas paid for Tx #21 through Tx #X**

3) Apply the Incentiv+ rate  
- **Incentiv+ (CENT) = 50% × Eligible Gas Paid (CENT)**

## Sample computations

Assume the usual gas fee per transaction is commonly around **17 CENT**, **16 CENT**, or **15 CENT**.

### Example 1 (less than 18 transactions)
If a user completes **18 transactions** in a day, they do not pass the 20-transaction threshold. That means there are **0 eligible transactions** beyond the first 20, and the user receives **0 CENT** as Incentiv+ for that day.

### Example 2 (24 total transactions, per-transaction fees)
If a user completes **24 transactions** in a day, then **4 transactions** are eligible (Tx #21 to Tx #24). If those eligible transactions have gas fees of **17 CENT**, **16 CENT**, **15 CENT**, and **16 CENT**, the eligible gas paid is **64 CENT**, and the user receives **32 CENT** as Incentiv+ (50% of 64 CENT).

### Example 3 (35 total transactions, typical fee average)
If a user completes **35 transactions** in a day, then **15 transactions** are eligible (Tx #21 to Tx #35). If the user’s typical gas fee averages **16 CENT** per transaction, the eligible gas paid is **240 CENT**, and the user receives **120 CENT** as Incentiv+ (50% of 240 CENT).

## Summary table

| Scenario | Total tx (X) | Eligible tx (X − 20) | Example fees counted (Tx #21 → #X) | Eligible Gas Paid (CENT) | Incentiv+ rate | Incentiv+ (CENT) |
|---|---:|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Less than 18 tx | 18 | 0 | None (threshold not reached) | 0 | 50% | 0 |
| 24 tx (per-tx fees) | 24 | 4 | 17, 16, 15, 16 | 64 | 50% | 32 |
| 35 tx (avg fee = 16) | 35 | 15 | 16 × 15 tx | 240 | 50% | 120 |
