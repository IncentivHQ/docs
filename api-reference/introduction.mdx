Welcome to the **Incentiv API Documentation** — your central resource for building on top of the Incentiv ecosystem.

This documentation includes two major components:

- **IncentiView API (Indexer)** – A structured, queryable interface for accessing blockchain data such as blocks, transactions, user operations, transfers, accounts, and assets.
- **Incentiv SDK** – A developer toolkit that simplifies blockchain interaction, account abstraction workflows, reward systems, and integration with dApps and wallets.

## Authentication

All endpoints are **public** on testnet. In production, API keys and quota limits may apply.

### **Response Format**

All endpoints return structured application/json responses. Entities share common metadata fields like timestamp, hash, and pagination controls (offset, limit, total).

## **Use Cases**

Here are some example ways you can use this API and SDK:

- Build your own **block explorer** or **activity dashboard**
- Integrate **wallet activity** into your application
- Track **token flows**, **rewards**, or **AA wallet usage**
- Power **search and analytics** interfaces for smart wallet adoption
